Cutebox is a Google Wave gadget that lets you draw, drag, and resize windowlike boxes collaboratively with your Wave friends.

To use:

Create a wave in the Google Wave sandbox.
Add another person to the wave.
Upload cuteboxes.xml to a web-accessible place.  Add the gadget to the wave (from Debug > Extensions > Add Gadget...)

Click to draw new cuteboxes.  Drag them by their middles.  Resize them with the lower-right corner resizer handle.
As you do this, the other person will see the cuteboxes syncing up.


Have fun & keep me updated :)
